## .NET 8

The major version jump from 2.x to 3.x is to signify the change in .NET version from 6 to 8.  There are a number of benefits to been on the latest version of .NET - 

* [Longer support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
* Access to the [latest features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8)
* [Performance Improvements](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/)

.NET 8 is the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of .NET and given that DBA Dash is now a couple of versions behind with support for .NET 6 running out next year - now is a good time to switch versions.

### What do I need to do?

You will need to download and install the .NET 8 Desktop runtime.  Installation is quick and painless and does't require a reboot.  The upgrade process will prevent the update until .NET 8 is installed.
