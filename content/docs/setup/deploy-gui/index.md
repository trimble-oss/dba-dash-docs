## Introduction

The GUI is packaged along with the DBA Dash service for convenience, but you might want to deploy this separately.

## Requirements

* Windows machine with [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)
* DBA Dash repository DB already [deployed](/docs/setup/quick-start).

## Security

To run the GUI, users only need access to the repository database.  No access is required to any of the monitored instances. Consider creating a group that grants access to DBA Dash.  To grant minimum permissions:

* Add the user/group to the "App" role in the DBA Dash repository database.  The role has SELECT and EXECUTE permissions.
* Optionally add the user to the ManageGlobalViews database role.  This allows users to save customized Metrics views for all users.

## Setup

1. [Download](https://github.com/trimble-oss/dba-dash/releases) the GUI_Only package
2. Extract it to a folder on your PC
3. Run DBADash.exe
4. Connect to the repository database.

The connection details are persisted on a per user basis in the AppData folder, encrypted using the DPAPI. The GUI will initially use the connection defined in the ServiceConfig.json file if itâ€™s available (where the service is deployed). 

 ## Upgrades

Users will automatically be prompted to upgrade if the GUI version is different from the repository. [See here](/docs/setup/upgrades/#upgrading-gui-clients)

 ## Other deployment options

 * Deploying the GUI to a network share is possible.  This might make upgrades harder with locked files though.
 * Deploying to a Google Drive is an option.
