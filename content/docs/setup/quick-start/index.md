The destination connection is the SQL instance where your DBA Dash repository database is to be located. By default this is set to DBADashDB and the database will be created automatically when the service starts. If you select an existing database it will need to be completely blank with no existing objects created.
{{< /callout >}}
{{< callout context="note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Use Windows authentication where possible.
{{< /callout >}}
 [ServiceConfig.json](/docs/help/security/#config-file-security) is used to store the connection details.
